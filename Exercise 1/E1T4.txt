Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Access to EC2 Instances:
- EC2 instances can be easily accessed if weak passwords are used or private keys are stored insecurely.

# Poor practice 2
Security groups
- Security groups may allow unrestricted access to EC2 instances or services, making them vulnerable to attackers scanning for open ports such as SSH or HTTP
