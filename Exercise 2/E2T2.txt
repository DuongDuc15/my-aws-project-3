Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. IAM policy grants full access to all resources, which could allow users to perform unauthorized actions on critical resources
2. EC2 instance is accessible from the internet through port 5000
3. CloudTrail is not specified, which can cause a lack of logs for monitoring API
4. Loadbalancer does not have HTTP->HTTPS redirection
5. Does not enforce the use of non-root accounts


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Restrict IAM policies to grant only the specific permissions for each user
2. Activate server-side encryption for all S3 buckets
3. Update the Application Load Balancer settings to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS 
4. Limit inbound and outbound traffic to only required ports; use referenced security groups for internal communication within the VPC
5. Configure CloudTrail to capture all API activity, store logs securely in an S3 bucket
